# James Powell Keynote

All code reviews:
Good code is code I wrote.
Bad code is code you wrote.

design - decisions made to address questions whose answesr are unknowable or unverifiable. Design isn't timeless. It's specific to a specific time. 

effort is the opposite - we know what we want and we write code to solve that want

what makes us better at design is judgement

what makes us better at effort is expertise
