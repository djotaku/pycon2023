Pycon 2023 Conference Notes

How to use this repo: 

PyCon will eventually post the talks to YouTube. See my notes to see if a talk seems worthwhile then look up the talk on YouTube. How comprehensive my notes are depends on:

- how familiar I was with the topic
- how quickly the speaker spoke
- how barebones the slides were

so they should really just be a tickler to see if you want to listen to the talk.
