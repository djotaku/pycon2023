# MQTT: A Pythonic introduction to the protocol for connected devices

Many use it for connected devices, but the speaker is inerested in industrial devices. First example is from a bio lab.

## The IT vs OT divide

OT is the operational tech while the IT is the info tech. The OT loop sends info to the IT loop and the IT loop tells the OT loop what to do.

Very different tech stacks on each side. They have different development cycles.

## MQTT Basics

Pub Sub - Publish and Subscribe - how the devices pass messages to each other

Everyone talks to each other via publishing to the MQTT Broker.

So to get info from the sensor you subscribe to it at the broker.

This model is better than peer-to-peer. Because it reduces network traffic.

Talk got derailed by techinical issues w/ the slides being presented. Became question/answer session.
