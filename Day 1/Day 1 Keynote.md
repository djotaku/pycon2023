High-uncertainty components in complex systems (ie People)

soft skills shouldn't be seen as lesser. The fact that it's less quantifiable as "hard skills" is what makes it actually harder to do well.

Peopel are terrible - if you treat them liek components

Part of what's hard is that there's Hidden State in people. This makes for non-linear responses. Something you think is minial can result in a giant output (anger, eg). And people have unclear error messages.

Need to spend time getting good at people because at some point you HAVE to interact with people. 

What's fantastic about people is that they are flexible, creative, full of energy, and they are the eventual consumers of what you develop

## How to Talk to People aka People: The API User's Guide

Every message sent to someone includes information and sentiment

And people will always find a sentiment even if you didn't put it in there.

- May come from the history they have had with you
- May come from percieved similarity (member of same group, country, race, gender, etc)
- Otherwise default will probably be a "bad" sentiment
- There's also hidden state from inside the person recieving the message

Improve your chances of proper communication 

- Say Yes - be more inviting
- Use more words - this can help clarify sentiment so they don't misinterpret
- Choose your words - make sure they are move inviting
- be humble 
- be explicit
