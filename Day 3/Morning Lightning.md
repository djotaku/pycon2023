# Day 3 Morning Lightning Talks

## Announcements talk

about various tralks taking place later

lots of announcements of world-wide Pycons

## PCBL with Real-World Tools

PCBl is personalized and self-paced. They care more about how competent the kids get, not the grades they get. 

Speaker uses github so that units of leraning can be structured as projects and used kanbans, etc

## Leadership and the Zen of Python

(watch talk again to get all the points)

## PyZombis serverless MOOC

Runs completely in student's browser - no server needed

Makes it cheaper to run

## Palindromic Python

Can you write python code that is a palindrome?

Parenthesis create an issue because of matching open paren with close paren.

Also assignment is problematic. You can't have integers and strings on both sides of the the equals sign.

## Web Scraping Woe and Workaround

wanted to scrape a website after logging in and had to play it safe because didn't want to lose account

used PyAutoGUI - which allows to script mouse and typing

mss - python package to take a screenshot

easyocr - another python package to do OCR

to do a fuzzy match used package called thefuzz (because sometimes the output from OCR wasn't quite right)

## Simplifying Pandas

data-agnostic - the logic doesn't change when the data changes
