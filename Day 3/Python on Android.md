Android is the largest web platform - this is why it matters

Even though Andriod is Java, Jython cannot be used - they don't even have a stable v3 yet

It's no longer hard to build CPython for Android

You can use most of the standard library

on-device development is the easiest way to do it. Termux is the most popular way.

Pydroid is an on-device IDE
