## Python: The People's Programming Language

Every developer is in the middle of all the global critical issues and tech trends

### Node/Individual - Connection

How to create a connection?

First you need to motivate connection to happen. One way is to connect with interests. Python can work with almost any genre. The speaker usually learns about new languages by working with music. Speaker used music21 to do very cool stuff with just a few lines of code.

See Intention slide - Guido designed Python from the beginning to allow the user to express their intention. Sometimes we focus on speed of program and forget speed of development.

Python is accessible because it's readable. 

Python also gives lots of choices. Speaker mentions Type Annocations as an example. It's not required (as it is in other languages) so you can use it when it makes sense.

Build confidence - the stearign council added a new section to peps called "how To Teach This" to help people learn how the PEPs work. (note from me: this is AWESOME!)

Once someone has confidence they're ready to create connections.

When someone has created a connection and made a request ask, they get back a response. They should make sure it's valid.

Be careful with your time/mental health. If you're feeling burnout - disconnect for a while so you can re-energize and come back strong.

### Group - Communication

summary from Guido quote - the audience for programs is other programmers

We will have more and more usage of Translators - making it so that different programming languages can work together

Outreach cluster - Python has lots of great outreach opportunities

Local Clusters - eg user groups

Virtual Clusters - pandemic showed us that everything can't always be live

Django Girls is a huge cluster

Important cluster work to do is the look at the clusters and ask who is missing and why? (eg diversity efforts)

### Networks - Scale

Speaker says this is Python's superpower

speaker says she tells people to "start small and scale"

Jupyter notebooks was a good example. Pyladies is another.

Speaker says mobile will help the next level of expansion. This is because many more folks have access to a mobile device than a desktop. PSP will make mobile core.

Also PS will make sure to have a good story for the web via WebAssembly

Important things to do
- join PSF
- participate in user groiups
- share knowledge
- take 5 minutes to inspire someone else
